### CoffeeCup Presentation

The following repository contains presentation notes and code snippets shown in the presentation by CoffeeCup at the Ember Munich meet up in Feb. 2017.

None of the following code directly reflects CoffeeCup, but has rather been modified to simplify its presentation and highlight the key messages from the presentation.

This repo is not intended to reflect a functioning application, and there are missing dependencies. The objective is simply to make large code examples available to those interested from the meet up.
